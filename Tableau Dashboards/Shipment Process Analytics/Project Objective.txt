Amazon Trade ships a variety of FMCG (Fast Moving Consumer Goods)all over the world.The Shipping Operator doesn't have much visibility and doesn't know how many orders are
processed and shipped on a monthly basis. A dashboard of this is needed where they select a month and can tell how many orders are outstanding a day and where they should be
shipped.

Amazon Trade has a database on Azure as well as Maria DB. The Shipping manager has
given us the details to connect to it.


Data Manipulation:
*Just a simple data dump from SQL's Northwind database to a CSV
*CSV (northwind.csv) turned into multiple CSVs
*CSVs imported into Mongo (mongo-import.sh)
*It's a straight data dump - no relations or special magic
